# LLVM — the LLVM compiler infrastructure project, C++ (llvm/llvm-project). A "BCR
# module" project: the runner bazel_dep()s llvm-project from the Bazel Central
# Registry and runs a scoped set of its own unit tests. Host tier on LOCAL + the
# LOCAL with the ambient toolchain — no hermetic LLVM. Pinned to
# BCR 17.0.4.bcr.1.
#
# The full @llvm-project//llvm/unittests:all is enormous; this scopes to the
# foundational unit tests that build on libSupport / libIR (ADT containers,
# Support, bitstream, FileCheck, and the IR tests the BCR presubmit names) — they
# build in a couple of minutes with a small footprint, not the whole of LLVM.
