# gflags — Google's C++ command-line flags library. Source pinned in
# //bazel_runner:extension.bzl (@gflags_archive, release v2.3.0). Its root BUILD
# builds the library through a gflags_library macro that loads cc_library from
# rules_cc, so it runs on the Bazel 9 inner with the hermetic LLVM toolchain.
# gflags' tests are CMake-only (test/ uses CMakeLists.txt), so there is no
# upstream Bazel test target — this is a build-only project. Its
# bazel/expanded_template/BUILD calls cc_binary *unloaded*, which Bazel 9 no
# longer autoloads, so it runs on the Bazel 8.7 inner (recent enough for
# hermetic-llvm, old enough to autoload the cc_* rules). PLATFORMS_DEP supplies
# @platforms visibility for the injected RBE platform (gflags' MODULE declares no
# direct platforms dep).
#
#   bazel run //projects/gflags:build_local_linux_amd64
