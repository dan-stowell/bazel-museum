# Source pinned in //bazel_runner:extension.bzl (@fast_float_archive, release
# v8.2.10), built with the fully-hermetic LLVM toolchain. Header-only, so its
# parity is the test suite, whose cc_test rules are unloaded and use doctest, so
# it runs on the Bazel 8.7 inner. PLATFORMS_DEP supplies the @platforms
# visibility the injected RBE platform package needs (fast_float's MODULE
# declares no platforms dep).
