# Crow — a header-only C++ microframework for building web services and APIs.
# Source pinned in //bazel_runner:extension.bzl (@crow_archive, release v1.3.2).
# First-party Bazel: pulls asio, zlib and catch2 from the BCR. Its root BUILD
# calls cc_library unloaded, so it runs on the Bazel 8.7 inner with the hermetic
# LLVM toolchain. Crow's Bazel cc_test exercises the SSL path through Asio,
# BoringSSL, Catch2, and the OpenSSL CLI. PLATFORMS_DEP supplies @platforms
# visibility for the injected RBE platform (Crow's MODULE declares no direct
# platforms dep).
