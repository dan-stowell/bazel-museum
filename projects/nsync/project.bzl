# nsync — Google's small C library of synchronization primitives (mutexes,
# condition variables, notes, once), with a C++ wrapper. Source pinned in
# //bazel_runner:extension.bzl (@nsync_archive, release 1.30.0), built with the
# upstream source/module as-is. The hermetic LLVM modification lives in
# //projects/nsync/hermetic_llvm. Its BUILD uses the unloaded cc_* rules, so it
# runs on the Bazel 8.7 inner. (nsync declares the platforms dep directly, so no
# PLATFORMS_DEP.)

    # and the file then includes <mutex> → not found. That fails under the
