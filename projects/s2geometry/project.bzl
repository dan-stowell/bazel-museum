# s2geometry — Google's S2, a C++ library for spherical geometry (cells, regions,
# indexing on the sphere; the math behind geographic systems). Source pinned in
# //bazel_runner:extension.bzl (@s2geometry_archive, a commit archive), built from the
# upstream source/module as-is. The hermetic LLVM modification lives in
# //projects/s2geometry/hermetic_llvm. First-party Bazel, but the Bazel module
# is rooted at the repo's src/ subdir (src/MODULE.bazel), so strip_prefix
# descends into src/ to make that the workspace root and targets are //:...
# It loads cc_* rules and its MODULE declares all deps (abseil, skylib,
# rules_cc, googletest) including platforms, so it runs on the default Bazel 9
# inner with no dep overlay.
