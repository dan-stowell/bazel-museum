# RBE Build Status

Last sweep: 2026-06-30, as-is `//projects/.../as_is:kiss_rbe_build` targets using BuildBuddy remote execution.

The `as_is` variant intentionally uses the upstream source/module without adding a C/C++ toolchain overlay. Variant-specific results live under variant subpackages, for example `//projects/<name>/as_is:kiss_build` or `//projects/<name>/hermetic_llvm:kiss_build`.

## Cause Buckets

- `pass`: 10 projects; as-is RBE build passed.
- `missing-remote-cc`: 97 projects; inner build uses an autodetected local C/C++ toolchain, but the remote worker does not provide `/bin/gcc`/`cc`.
- `go-cgo-cc`: 3 projects; rules_go stdlib/cgo expects `cc` on the remote worker.
- `source-overlay-required`: 2 projects; source tree needs a `MODULE.bazel`/`WORKSPACE` overlay before Bazel can run.
- `missing-remote-jdk`: 1 project; inner build autoconfigured a local JDK that is absent on the remote worker.
- `project-toolchain-runtime`: 1 project; project-selected toolchain reaches the remote worker, but required runtime libraries are too old.
- `other`: 0 projects; needs a closer look at the failing inner build output.
