"""Module extension fetching a hermetic, pinned `crun` (static OCI runtime).

`crun` runs the //runner/image rootfs **daemonlessly and rootlessly** — no
dockerd, no host-installed runtime. We download the official statically-linked
release binary (a single self-contained ELF) and expose it as a file. Pinning
version + sha256 keeps it reproducible and removes any dependency on a host
container runtime, exactly as the museum does for `gh`, `zip`, and `bazelisk`.

linux amd64 + arm64 are wired up. To bump: update CRUN_VERSION and the sha256s
(sha256sum of each release asset at
github.com/containers/crun/releases/download/<v>/crun-<v>-linux-<arch>).
