"""Reusable, named *overlays* — bundles of source edits + flags for a goal.

An overlay captures everything needed to make some project build/test under some
condition (a toolchain, an environment like remote cache / RBE, a project fix):

  * appends   — list of (file_label, dest): append file onto dest in the source
                (e.g. inject a toolchain into MODULE.bazel, flags into .bazelrc)
  * writes    — list of (file_label, dest): copy file verbatim to dest (creating
                parent dirs), e.g. drop a patch + BUILD marker into a fresh
                package. Unlike appends, no leading newline / no existing file.
  * patches   — list of unified-diff file labels applied with `patch -p1`
  * build_flags        — flags added to the inner `bazel <command>`
  * remote_header_envs — "ENVVAR:HEADER" pairs; the runner reads ENVVAR and adds
                         --remote_header=HEADER=<value> (keeps secrets off disk)

Overlays compose: a project sets base overlays for all its goals, and each goal
can add more (e.g. a remote-execution overlay). This is how we capture
overlays/patches per (project x goal x environment).
