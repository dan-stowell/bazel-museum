# Source pinned in //bazel_runner:extension.bzl (@zlib_archive, release v1.3.2),
# built from the upstream source/module as-is. The hermetic LLVM modification
# lives in //projects/zlib/hermetic_llvm. zlib ships first-party Bazel files
# (MODULE.bazel + a BUILD that loads rules_cc), so the default 9.1.1 inner
# builds it as-authored.
# Build-only: zlib's BUILD declares the library (//:zlib, an alias to //:z) but
# no Bazel test targets.
