# nlohmann/json — JSON for Modern C++ (header-only).
# Source pinned in //kiss:extension.bzl (@json_archive, v3.12.0), built
# with the fully-hermetic LLVM toolchain.
#
# Build-only — and unlike grpc (Bazel-first) or brotli (Bazel go_test), there's
# no minimal way to run its tests under Bazel. nlohmann/json is a CMake project;
# its BUILD.bazel is a consumption shim that exposes the header library only.
# The test suite *is* in the tarball (tests/src/unit-*.cpp, 69 files, with
# doctest vendored) but it's wired into CMake/CTest, with zero Bazel test rules —
# and ~15 files also need the separate `json_test_data` repo. The minimal-effort
# routes don't apply: Gazelle generates Go/proto BUILDs, not C++ cc_test, and
# there's no drop-in tool that runs a CMake/doctest suite as `bazel test`.
# Running these would mean authoring our own cc_test over their sources — i.e.
# porting the suite — which we deliberately don't do.
