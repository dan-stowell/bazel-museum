# and data-marshalling system widely used in robotics. Source pinned in
# //bazel_runner:extension.bzl (@lcm_archive, v1.5.2). First-party Bazel, run on
# the 8.7 inner. The hermetic LLVM modification lives in //projects/lcm/hermetic_llvm.
# We build the static C++ library
# and run a C++ unit test. LCM's MODULE declares a direct platforms dep (no
# PLATFORMS_DEP).
