# RocksDB — Facebook's embedded persistent key-value store / LSM-tree engine, C++
# (facebook/rocksdb). A "BCR module" project: the runner bazel_dep()s rocksdb from
# the Bazel Central Registry and builds its library + runs a scoped set of its own
# unit tests. LOCAL uses the ambient host toolchain; no hermetic LLVM. Pinned to
# BCR 9.11.2.
#
# Runs on the Bazel 8.7 inner: rocksdb's test graph (via googletest 1.17) trips a
# rule Bazel 9 removed, which 8.7 still provides. Compression backends lz4/zlib/
# zstd are enabled (the module's config flags, matching its presubmit); bzip2 is
# off (the bzip2 BCR module lacks the :bz2 target rocksdb expects) and so is
# liburing.
#
# The library builds -c opt (librocksdb.a/.so, ~3.5 min). The tests build in
# fastbuild (NOT -c opt): rocksdb's shared test lib references TEST_* hooks that
# are compiled out under NDEBUG. The full @rocksdb//:all is ~195 tests incl. slow
# db/stress suites; this scopes to fast, deterministic util/memory/monitoring/
# options unit tests.
