# quill — an asynchronous, low-latency C++ logging library. Source pinned in
# //bazel_runner:extension.bzl (@quill_archive, release v12.0.0). First-party
# Bazel (bzlmod): its root BUILD calls cc_library unloaded, so it runs on the
# Bazel 8.7 inner. The hermetic LLVM modification lives in
# //projects/quill/hermetic_llvm. No upstream Bazel test
# target, so this is a build-only project. quill's MODULE declares a direct
# platforms dep, so no PLATFORMS_DEP overlay.
