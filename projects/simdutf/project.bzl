# simdutf — fast SIMD Unicode validation & transcoding (UTF-8/16/32, base64), C++.
# This is a "BCR module" project: rather than pinning the upstream source and
# running its in-repo BUILD, the runner synthesizes a root module that
# bazel_dep()s simdutf from the Bazel Central Registry and builds/tests its own
# @simdutf//... targets — the build_targets/test_targets the BCR's presubmit.yml
# runs. The registry resolves simdutf's source, patches, and MODULE.bazel.
# Pinned to BCR 7.7.0.
#
# Toolchain by env (bcr_project default): LOCAL builds with the ambient host gcc
# (no hermetic overlay); RBE uses hermetic LLVM (the host
# toolchain can't match the remote executor's compiler).
