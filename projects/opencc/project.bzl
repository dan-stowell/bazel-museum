# OpenCC — Open Chinese Convert, conversion between Traditional/Simplified
# Chinese (C++). Source pinned in //bazel_runner:extension.bzl (@opencc_archive,
# release ver.1.3.1), built from the upstream source/module as-is. The hermetic
# LLVM modification lives in //projects/opencc/hermetic_llvm.
#
# The library (//:opencc) pulls a handful of BCR modules (marisa-trie,
# darts-clone, rapidjson, tclap); some call cc_* unloaded, so it runs on the
# Bazel 8.7 inner. (OpenCC declares platforms directly, so no PLATFORMS_DEP.)
