"""Environments: where a goal's inner build actually runs.

An *environment* provisions execution capacity and declares which (os, arch)
platforms it can serve. museum_project crosses environments x platforms x
commands to emit the concrete `<command>_<env>_<os>_<arch>` goal targets (see
//builds:defs.bzl).

Fields:
  * name        — token used in target names (`local`, `rbe`).
  * platforms   — list of PLATFORMS keys this environment can serve.
  * overlays    — overlays applied to every goal in this environment (e.g. the
                  BuildBuddy connection for `rbe`).
  * pin_platform — if True, the goal injects museum_rbe/ and pins --platforms /
                  --extra_execution_platforms / --host_platform to its platform.
                  Used by remote environments so the build is fully explicit
                  about os/arch instead of inheriting the orchestrating host's.
  * host_only   — if True, each goal only runs when the *host* matches its
                  platform (via target_compatible_with). This is how `local`
                  models "one OS/arch at a time": on this laptop only the
                  darwin_arm64 goals are live; on the linux VM only linux_amd64.
  * platform_flags — dict platform-name -> extra build flags applied only to
                  goals on that platform (e.g. a toolchain flag a particular
                  os/arch needs in this environment).

To add an environment (e.g. a future `actiond`), define it here with the
platforms it supports and add it to a project's `environments = [...]`.

#
# darwin_arm64 uses the *prebuilt* hermetic-llvm toolchain (the default `source`)
# like linux does — the compiler is downloaded and only the compiler-rt builtins
# build from source (~600 actions for an abseil target). We deliberately do NOT
# force `--@llvm//toolchain:source=bootstrapped`: that rebuilds clang/LLVM from
# source on the executor (~13k actions, ~22x more) and was only needed before the
# HERMETIC_LLVM `-isysroot` backport, when the toolchain's host-tool compiles fell
# through to host Xcode. With that patch the prebuilt path is hermetic on the
# executor (no Xcode-path errors), so no per-platform flag is required.

#
# actiond boots a Linux guest of the *host's* CPU arch (it starts an embedded
# qemu-system with -accel kvm), so it serves the linux platform matching the
# host: linux_amd64 on an x86_64 host, linux_arm64 on an arm64 host (incl. an
# arm64 macOS host running a Linux guest). host_cpu_only gates each goal on the
# host CPU so only the matching-arch cell is live. pin_platform makes the build
# explicit about os/arch (HERMETIC_LLVM cross-targets linux regardless of host).
# Requires KVM access and the worker running: `bazel run //tools/actiond:serve`.
