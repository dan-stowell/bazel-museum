# bazel-museum

**A collection of real open-source projects you can build and test *as they
ship* — with nothing but [bazelisk] and the handful of host tools that
real-world Bazel projects quietly assume. The point is to enumerate exactly what
those tools are.**

Almost no Bazel project in the wild builds with bazelisk *alone*: the moment
anything compiles, Bazel's C/C++ toolchain auto-configuration probes the host
for `gcc`/`cc` — and that's just the start (some projects also reach for a JDK,
python, git, or curl). This repo pins that "ordinary CI machine" into a single
container image built **entirely with Bazel** ([rules_img] + [rules_distroless]),
then builds and tests each project's *upstream* `MODULE`/`BUILD` inside it — no
overlays, no patches, no injected toolchains. What works, and what host tool
each project leans on, is the result.

> Looking for the hermetic-by-injection builds, remote execution on BuildBuddy,

## Quick start

You need **bazelisk** and **docker**. Nothing else — not even a compiler; the
toolchain lives in the image.

```sh
# 1. Get bazelisk (it becomes your `bazel`; it downloads the exact Bazel each
#    project pins). On a bare Linux box:
sudo curl -fsSL -o /usr/local/bin/bazel \
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases/download/v1.25.0/bazelisk-linux-amd64
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bazel
#    (macOS/Windows/other arches: see the bazelisk releases page.)

# 2. Build the "build it as it is" container once (rules_img assembles it and
#    loads it into docker as bazel-wild-baseline:latest):
bazel run //wild/image:load

# 3. Build and test any project, exactly as upstream ships it:
bazel run //wild/re2:build      # fetches re2's pinned source, runs its own BUILD
bazel run //wild/re2:test       # runs re2's upstream test suite in the container
```

Each `//wild/<project>:build` / `:test` target fetches the project's pinned
source, mounts it into the container, and runs `bazelisk` against the upstream
`MODULE`/`BUILD` with the project's known-good Bazel version pinned. The first
build of a project compiles from scratch; reruns hit a warm cache.

### Doesn't build as-is

- **brotli** — ships no `MODULE.bazel` (WORKSPACE-only), so bzlmod sees no workspace
- **brotli (Go)** — same archive as brotli — no `MODULE.bazel`
- **doctest** — root `//:doctest` uses `includes=["."]`, rejected for the main module (it's meant to be consumed as a dep)
- **gRPC** — its `tools/bazel` wrapper downloads its own Bazel, which then can't find the host `gcc`
<!-- END GENERATED TABLE -->

The Bazel column is the version bazelisk pins for that project (its known-good
inner). Most projects that don't pin a `.bazelversion` need it: bazelisk would
otherwise pick the latest Bazel, which dropped the autoloaded `cc_*`/`sh_test`
built-ins and breaks their `load`-less BUILD files.

## The host tools, enumerated

The whole exercise is to make the host dependency *explicit*. With **bazelisk
alone** — a strict image of a libc, CA certs, and the bazelisk binary, nothing
else ([`bazel run //wild/image:strict_load`](wild/image/BUILD.bazel)) — **zero**
of these projects build. The wall is always the same:

```
Auto-Configuration Error: Cannot find gcc or CC; either correct your path
or set the CC environment variable
```

Even pure-Go (buildifier) and Rust (`cxx`) projects hit it — `rules_go` and
`rules_rust` eagerly configure a host C toolchain for cgo/linking. So the image
([`//wild/image`](wild/image)) carries the set of host tools a real CI runner has
and that these projects reach for:

| Tool | Why a Bazel project reaches for it | Seen with |
|------|------------------------------------|-----------|
| **gcc / g++** (build-essential) | Bazel's C/C++ toolchain auto-configuration | **every compiling project** — the universal wall (proven by the strict image) |
| **python3** | build-time scripts in the build graph | protobuf, grpc, … |
| **git** | a `git_repository` fetch at build time | ortools |
| **curl** | a `tools/bazel` wrapper that downloads its own Bazel | grpc |
| **zip / unzip** | genrules that shell out to archivers | bazel (install-base) |
| **JDK** (default-jdk-headless) | host `java` for Java projects / genrules | copybara, bazel (a generic CI machine has one) |

That table *is* the finding: the gap between "has a green BUILD" and "builds on
a clean machine" is a short, nameable list of host assumptions — and the
container is where they're pinned down reproducibly. Only the compiler is
*proven* universal here (remove it → the strict image fails everything); the
rest are the assumptions these specific projects exercised.

## How it works

- **[`wild/image`](wild/image)** — the container, assembled entirely with Bazel.
  [rules_img] stacks the layers onto a pinned `debian:bookworm-slim`; the host
  toolchain rides on top as hermetic `.deb` layers resolved by
  [rules_distroless] from a pinned Debian snapshot
  ([`toolchain.yaml`](wild/image/toolchain.yaml)). No `apt install` at image
  build time, no Dockerfile.
- **[`wild/<project>`](wild)** — one `:build` and `:test` target per project,
  generated by [`wild/gen_targets.py`](wild/gen_targets.py) from the project
  list. Each runs [`wild/run.sh`](wild/run.sh): fetch the pinned source (verified
  against [`tools/fetch`](tools/fetch)), mount it, run `bazelisk` in the image.
- **[`wild/verify.sh`](wild/verify.sh)** — the build+test sweep that produces the
  table above; a test command is listed only when its upstream suite actually runs
  and passes in the image (partial passes are annotated `N/M pass` inline).

## Explorations

Earlier directions that proved out real capability but go beyond the headline
goal are documented under **[explorations/](explorations)**:

- **[The hermetic museum](explorations#1-the-hermetic-museum-builds)** — the same
  projects built *hermetically by injection* (pinned inner Bazel + fully-hermetic
  LLVM, no host toolchain at all), including Bazel itself.
- **[Remote execution on BuildBuddy](explorations#2-remote-execution-on-buildbuddy-rbe)**
  and **[actiond](explorations#3-actiond--a-local-linux-re-worker-toolsactiond)** —
  the hermetic builds run on cloud and local RE.
- **[The discovery pipeline](explorations#4-the-discovery-pipeline-pipeline)** —
  how the projects were chosen, ranked by recognition × maintained × buildability.

See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the hermetic architecture and
[docs/KICKOFF.md](docs/KICKOFF.md) for the project's original intent.
