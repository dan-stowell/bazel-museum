# FTXUI — a functional C++ terminal-UI library (screen / dom / component).
# Source pinned in //bazel_runner:extension.bzl (@ftxui_archive, release v7.0.0),
# built from the upstream source/module as-is. The hermetic LLVM modification
# lives in //projects/ftxui/hermetic_llvm. FTXUI ships first-party Bazel
# files, but its test target pulls in googletest (cc_* unloaded), so it runs on
# the Bazel 8.7 inner like the other googletest-consuming C++ projects. (It
# declares a direct `platforms` dep, so no PLATFORMS_DEP overlay is needed.)
