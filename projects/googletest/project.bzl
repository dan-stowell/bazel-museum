# GoogleTest — the C++ test framework.
# Source pinned in //bazel_runner:extension.bzl (@googletest_archive, v1.17.0),
# built from the upstream source/module as-is. The hermetic LLVM modification
# lives in //projects/googletest/hermetic_llvm. The iconic artifacts: the gtest
# + gtest_main libraries (//:gtest bundles gmock).
#
# googletest 1.17.0's BUILD files (root + the test packages) call cc_library/
# cc_test/cc_binary unloaded, which Bazel 9 removed from the builtins. Rather
# than patch a load() into every package, we run the Bazel 8.7 inner — recent
# enough to carry the zero-sysroot hermetic-llvm toolchain (needs repo_metadata,
# added in 8.3), and old enough to still autoload the cc_* rules as authored.
