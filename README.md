# bazel-museum: reproducible real-world Bazel builds

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. Get bazelisk.
sudo curl -fsSL -o /usr/local/bin/bazel \
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases/download/v1.25.0/bazelisk-linux-amd64
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bazel

# 2. Optionally prebuild the container image artifact:
bazel build //runner/image:oci_layout

# 3. Build and test a project; this also builds the image artifact if needed:
bazel run //projects/re2:build      # fetches re2's pinned source, runs its own BUILD
bazel run //projects/re2:test       # runs re2's upstream test suite in the image

# Optional: run the same upstream build/test directly on the local host:
bazel run //projects/re2:local_build
bazel run //projects/re2:local_test
```

Each `//projects/<project>:build` / `:test` target fetches the project's pinned
source, builds the shared image artifact as a Bazel dependency, extracts that
image rootfs into `~/.cache/runner` by manifest digest, then runs `bazelisk`
against the upstream `MODULE`/`BUILD` inside it (via
[crun](https://github.com/containers/crun) in a rootless OCI bundle) with the
project's known-good Bazel pinned. The first build compiles from scratch; reruns
hit a warm cache.

The `:local_build` / `:local_test` variants use the same pinned source, Bazel
version, targets, and cache layout, but run directly on the host with the host's
toolchain and installed tools.

## Host-local build/test sweep

The same upstream builds and tests run directly on the host toolchain via the
`:local_build` / `:local_test` targets (no container). Swept by
[`runner/local_sweep.sh`](runner/local_sweep.sh) into `runner/local-results.tsv`
and rendered by [`runner/_local_table.py`](runner/_local_table.py).
