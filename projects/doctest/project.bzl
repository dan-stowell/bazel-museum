# doctest — the fast, header-only C++ unit-testing framework.
# Source pinned in //kiss:extension.bzl (@doctest_archive, release
# v2.5.2), built with the fully-hermetic LLVM toolchain. Its BUILD files
# explicitly load the cc_* rules from @rules_cc, so it runs on the default Bazel
# 9.1.1 inner.
#
# doctest's only Bazel test lives in its examples/ tree, which is a *nested*
# standalone module (its own MODULE.bazel + WORKSPACE.bazel that pull doctest
# back in via local_path_override="..", like magic_enum's test/). So we extract
# the full archive root and run inner Bazel from examples/, leaving the parent
# doctest module available as @doctest. examples/ already declares rules_cc and
# bazel_skylib; it lacks platforms, so PLATFORMS_DEP supplies @platforms for the
# injected RBE platform package.
#
#   bazel run //projects/doctest:build_local_linux_amd64
#   bazel run //projects/doctest:test_local_linux_amd64
