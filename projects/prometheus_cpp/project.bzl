# prometheus-cpp — the Prometheus metrics client library for C++. Source pinned
# in //bazel_runner:extension.bzl (@prometheus_cpp_archive, v1.3.0). First-party
# Bazel; its BUILD files call cc_* unloaded, so it runs on the 8.7 inner.
# The hermetic LLVM modification lives in //projects/prometheus_cpp/hermetic_llvm.
# We build the core library and run its unit tests; the //pull
# exposer's integration tests stand up a live HTTP server, so they're left out.
# prometheus-cpp's MODULE declares a direct platforms dep (no PLATFORMS_DEP).
