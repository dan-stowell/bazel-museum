# cpu_features — Google's library for runtime CPU feature detection (C).
# Source pinned in //bazel_runner:extension.bzl (@cpu_features_archive, release
# v0.11.0), built from the upstream source/module as-is. The hermetic LLVM
# modification lives in //projects/cpu_features/hermetic_llvm. First-party Bazel; its
# tests use googletest (cc_* unloaded), so it runs on the Bazel 8.7 inner.
# (cpu_features declares platforms directly, so no PLATFORMS_DEP.)
