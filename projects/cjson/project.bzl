# cJSON — ultralightweight JSON parser in C (DaveGamble/cJSON). A "BCR module"
# project: the runner bazel_dep()s cjson from the Bazel Central Registry and runs
# its own @cjson//... targets. LOCAL uses the ambient host gcc; RBE uses hermetic
# LLVM. Pinned to BCR 1.7.19 (bcr.4).
#
# One of cjson's 22 tests is sensitive to the compiler/libc. This is a small,
# real reminder that the host tier is not reproducible across toolchains.
