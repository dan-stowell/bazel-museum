# highway — Google's portable SIMD/vector library (C++).
# Source pinned in //bazel_runner:extension.bzl (@highway_archive, release
# 1.4.0), built from the upstream source/module as-is. The hermetic LLVM
# modification lives in //projects/highway/hermetic_llvm. The library loads
# rules_cc, but its test suite depends on googletest (cc_* unloaded), so it runs
# on the Bazel 8.7 inner like the other googletest-consuming C++ projects.
